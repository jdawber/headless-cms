# Headless CMS

A personal project to create a headless content management system.

## Vision

I love creating applications to help others create websites. My vision would be to have my own SaaS application which would help me launch my own company.

2. Expose data in an API.
3. Implement a basic visual editor.

Further phases:

1. Add workspace stages so changes can be published
2. Add Authentication. (AWS Cognito?)
3. Deploy to AWS.
4. Multiple environments (dev/staging/production).
5. Multiple site support/localisation, eg, en-GB / de-DE, en-US,
6. Multi-tenancy support
7. ðŸ¤”

## Tech stack

1. NextJS
2. AWS
3. Terraform
